-- Inner expression `s_acctbal * pick + 1000 * (1 - pick)` is linear in
-- pick after distribution: `(s_acctbal - 1000) * pick + 1000`. The
-- multiply-over-add distributor + per-row LHS-constant-to-RHS handling
-- now make this work end-to-end.

-- --- C9: Composed MIN with SUM inside ---------------------------------
-- Branch: composed aggregate — MIN(linear-in-pick) >= K (easy direction,

  AND SUM(pick) = 10

DECIDE pick IS BOOLEAN
SUCH THAT SUM(s_acctbal * pick) <= (SELECT AVG(s_acctbal) * 20 FROM supplier)
MAXIMIZE SUM(pick);

-- --- C14: Correlated scalar subquery in constraint --------------------
-- Branch: per-row correlated subquery RHS, decision variable on both
-- sides. Rearranges to `(s_acctbal - subq) * pick >= 0` per row. Two
-- terms reference the same `pick` variable; the per-row LHS coefficient
-- aggregator merges them into a single Gurobi column entry.

-- --- C22: MAX(ABS(expr)) <= K constraint (easy, sound) ---------------
-- Branch: ABS inside MAX aggregate, easy direction MAX(...) <= K
-- stripped to per-row ABS(...) <= K. Both bounds individually upper-

-- (Prior version of C22 used MIN(ABS) >= K which is the unsound
-- hard direction — now rejected at bind time; see R26 in 05_rejected.sql.)
SELECT s_suppkey, s_acctbal, qty
FROM supplier
DECIDE qty IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT qty <= 10
  AND MAX(ABS(qty - 4)) <= 3
MAXIMIZE SUM(s_acctbal * qty);

-- --- C23: SUM(ABS(expr)) <= K aggregate (sound) -----------------------
-- Branch: SUM of ABS — solver naturally picks aux_i = |e_i| because each
-- aux is lower-bounded individually and only their sum is upper-bounded.
-- (Prior version used MAX(ABS) >= K which is the unsound hard direction —
-- now rejected at bind time; see R27 in 05_rejected.sql.)
SELECT s_suppkey, s_acctbal, qty
FROM supplier

FROM supplier
DECIDE qty IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT qty <= 10
  AND qty = 7 WHEN (s_nationkey <= 5)
MAXIMIZE SUM(qty);

-- --- C30: Per-row quadratic constraint POWER(linear, 2) <= K ----------

-- The per-row form emits one quadratic constraint per data row.
SELECT p_partkey, p_retailprice, qty
FROM part
WHERE p_size < 5
DECIDE qty IS REAL
SUCH THAT qty <= 10
  AND POWER(qty - 5, 2) <= 9
MAXIMIZE SUM(p_retailprice * qty);

-- --- C31: Hard MAX(...) constraint with WHEN --------------------------
-- Branch: hard-direction MAX (Big-M indicators) composed with WHEN row
-- filter. M10 covers MIN-easy + WHEN; C7 covers hard MAX without WHEN.
-- The combination affects which rows participate in the indicator pool.
SELECT s_suppkey, s_nationkey, s_acctbal, pick
FROM supplier
DECIDE pick IS BOOLEAN
SUCH THAT MAX(s_acctbal * pick) >= 8000 WHEN (s_nationkey <= 10)
  AND SUM(pick) <= 30
MAXIMIZE SUM(pick);

-- --- C32: Bilinear constraint with WHEN + PER -------------------------
-- Branch: McCormick bilinear (bool * int) under both WHEN row filter and
-- PER grouping. C11/P9 cover bilinear without filters; M5/M7 cover
-- WHEN/PER on linear. This combination exercises bilinear constraint
-- emission per group with row filtering.
SELECT p_partkey, p_size, p_retailprice, pick, qty
FROM part
WHERE p_size < 10
DECIDE pick IS BOOLEAN, qty IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT qty <= 20

-- Branch: hard-direction ABS in constraint, Big-M sign-indicator pair
-- (aux <= e + 2M(1-y), aux <= -e + 2M*y) on top of the lower envelope.
-- Was previously rejected (R26 in old 05_rejected.sql); now solves.

SUCH THAT qty <= 10 AND ABS(qty - 5) >= 3
MAXIMIZE SUM(qty);

-- --- C34: ABS equality (ABS = K) --------------------------------------

-- exactly; the equality then forces |inner| = K. qty in {2, 8}.

FROM supplier
DECIDE qty IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT qty <= 10 AND ABS(qty - 5) = 3
MAXIMIZE SUM(qty);

SUCH THAT qty <= 10 AND MIN(ABS(qty - 4)) >= 1
MAXIMIZE SUM(qty);

-- --- C36: SUM(ABS) >= K (aggregate hard direction) --------------------
-- Branch: aggregate hard direction over ABS. Each aux pinned via Big-M;
-- the SUM aggregate then operates on pinned auxes. With qty<=10, max
-- SUM(|qty-5|) = 100*5 = 500, so 200 is comfortably feasible.

DECIDE qty IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT qty <= 10 AND SUM(ABS(qty - 5)) >= 200
MAXIMIZE SUM(qty);

-- --- C37: ABS in BETWEEN ----------------------------------------------
-- Branch: BETWEEN over ABS — desugars to two comparisons, both bounding
-- aux. Lower bound is hard direction; upper bound is sound. Big-M on
-- aux makes both comparisons exact. qty in {1,2,3,7,8,9}. MAX picks 9.
SELECT s_suppkey, qty
FROM supplier
DECIDE qty IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT qty <= 10 AND ABS(qty - 5) BETWEEN 2 AND 4
MAXIMIZE SUM(qty);
