-- Focused, minimal queries that exercise each comparison operator branch
-- on its own. Shape coverage (per-row vs aggregate, MIN/MAX, quadratic,
-- bilinear, subqueries) lives in 01_constraints.sql.

-- --- OP1: Equality (=) on per-row ------------------------------------
-- Branch: per-row equality pins variables to a scalar.

FROM supplier
DECIDE qty IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT qty = 4
MAXIMIZE SUM(s_acctbal * qty);

-- --- OP2: Less-than-or-equal (<=) per-row ----------------------------
-- Branch: per-row upper bound; canonical linear inequality.

FROM part
WHERE p_size < 5
DECIDE qty IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT qty <= 8
MAXIMIZE SUM(p_retailprice * qty);

-- --- OP3: Greater-than-or-equal (>=) per-row -------------------------
-- Branch: per-row lower bound on a real var.
SELECT p_partkey, p_retailprice, qty
FROM part
WHERE p_size < 5
DECIDE qty IS REAL
SUCH THAT qty <= 10
  AND qty >= 2
MAXIMIZE SUM(p_retailprice * qty);

-- --- OP4: Strict less-than (<) per-row -------------------------------
-- Branch: < requires integer-valued LHS; encodes as <= K-1.

DECIDE v IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT v > 2

-- --- OP6: Not-equal (<>) per-row -------------------------------------
-- Branch: Big-M disjunction; integer LHS required.
SELECT s_suppkey, qty
FROM supplier
DECIDE qty IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT qty <= 10
  AND qty <> 7
MAXIMIZE SUM(qty);

-- --- OP7: BETWEEN per-row --------------------------------------------
-- Branch: BETWEEN K1 AND K2 desugars to two inequality constraints.
SELECT s_suppkey, qty
FROM supplier
DECIDE qty IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT qty BETWEEN 2 AND 9
MAXIMIZE SUM(qty);

-- --- OP8: BETWEEN on aggregate ---------------------------------------

-- --- OP9: IN on data column (filter) ---------------------------------

DECIDE qty IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT qty IN (0, 2, 5, 9)

-- --- OP11: AND of multiple per-row constraints -----------------------
-- Branch: AND chains constraints — each becomes an independent linear row.

FROM part
WHERE p_size < 5
DECIDE qty IS INTEGER
SUCH THAT qty >= 2 AND qty <= 8 AND qty <> 5
MAXIMIZE SUM(p_retailprice * qty);

-- --- OP12: AND mixing per-row and aggregate constraints --------------
