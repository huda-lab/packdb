FROM supplier
DECIDE pick IS BOOLEAN
SUCH THAT SUM(pick) <= 5 WHEN (pick = 1)
MAXIMIZE SUM(pick);

-- --- R15: Division by decision variable -------------------------------
-- Expected: rejected — non-linear.
-- BUG (UX): "INTERNAL Error: FromSymbolic: Non-integer exponents are not
--           supported in DECIDE normalization" — error message is correct
--           in spirit but leaks internal terminology; should be a clean

-- --- R17: Negative-domain variable (no explicit bounds syntax) --------
-- Expected: rejected (or interpreted as non-negative).
-- ACTUAL: silently accepted — `pick >= -5` is trivially satisfied because
--         vars are implicitly [0, +∞). The query runs and pick saturates
--         at upper bound (5). User's apparent intent (allow negative) is
--         silently ignored with no warning. Worth surfacing a hint.

-- --- R18: AVG inside POWER (nested non-linear over decision var) ------

-- BUG (UX): "INTERNAL Error: DECIDE objective contains a non-aggregate
--           term: power(sum(qty), CAST(2 AS DOUBLE))" — should be a clean
--           Invalid Input error.

FROM part
DECIDE qty IS REAL
SUCH THAT qty <= 10

-- --- R19: Multiple quadratic groups in one objective ------------------
-- Expected: rejected — only one quadratic group per objective allowed.

FROM part
WHERE p_size < 3
DECIDE x IS REAL, y IS REAL
SUCH THAT x <= 5 AND y <= 5
MINIMIZE SUM(POWER(x, 2)) + SUM(POWER(y, 2));

-- --- R20: IN on aggregate (SUM) ---------------------------------------
-- Expected: rejected — IN is per-row only, not on aggregates.
SELECT s_suppkey, pick
FROM supplier
DECIDE pick IS BOOLEAN
SUCH THAT SUM(pick) IN (5, 10, 15)
MAXIMIZE SUM(pick);

-- --- R21: Strict < on REAL/non-integer LHS ----------------------------
-- Expected: rejected — strict inequality requires integer-valued LHS.
SELECT p_partkey, qty
FROM part
DECIDE qty IS REAL
SUCH THAT qty < 5
MAXIMIZE SUM(qty);

-- --- R22: <> on REAL/non-integer LHS ----------------------------------
-- Expected: rejected — <> requires integer-valued LHS.

SUCH THAT qty <> 3.5
MAXIMIZE SUM(qty);

-- --- R23: CEIL/CEILING over decision variable -------------------------
-- Expected: rejected — non-linear scalar function.
-- BUG (UX): "INTERNAL Error: ToSymbolic: Unsupported function: ceil" —
--           should be a clean Binder error.

FROM part
DECIDE qty IS REAL
SUCH THAT qty <= 10
MAXIMIZE SUM(CEIL(qty));

-- --- R24: LOG over decision variable ----------------------------------
-- Expected: rejected — non-linear; verifies LOG is treated like LN.
-- BUG (UX): "INTERNAL Error: ToSymbolic: Unsupported function: log" —
--           should be a clean Binder error.
SELECT p_partkey, qty
FROM part
DECIDE qty IS REAL
SUCH THAT qty <= 10 AND qty >= 1
MAXIMIZE SUM(LOG(qty));

-- --- R25: Empty aggregate after WHEN (non-PER) ------------------------
-- Expected per docs: rejected — WHEN filters out every row leaving SUM(∅).
-- ACTUAL: silently no-ops. Constraint SUM(∅) <= 5 is treated as 0 <= 5
--         (trivially true), picks become unconstrained, and all saturate
--         at 1. Either the docs are stale (non-PER WHEN-empty also gets
--         the silent-skip treatment, parallel to PER groups) or this is
--         a real gap that should error. Worth surfacing.
SELECT s_suppkey, s_acctbal, pick
FROM supplier
DECIDE pick IS BOOLEAN
SUCH THAT SUM(pick) <= 5 WHEN (s_acctbal > 9999999)
MAXIMIZE SUM(s_acctbal * pick);
