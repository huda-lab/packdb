-- --- M2: WHEN on an aggregate constraint ------------------------------
-- Branch: filter rows contributing to an aggregate.
-- NOTE: WHEN's condition grammar (b_expr) excludes top-level AND/OR and
--       disallows IN/IS NULL/etc. without parens. Wrap complex predicates
--       in parentheses.

-- --- M10: WHEN on MIN aggregate ---------------------------------------
-- Branch: WHEN filter on a MIN aggregate (easy direction, per-row bound).
-- Fixed feasibility: relaxed bound so a non-empty feasible set exists.
SELECT s_suppkey, s_nationkey, s_acctbal, pick
FROM supplier
DECIDE pick IS BOOLEAN
SUCH THAT MIN(s_acctbal * pick) >= 0 WHEN (s_acctbal > 1000)

-- --- M15: WHEN with NULL in predicate (treated as false) --------------
-- Branch: NULL-producing WHEN predicate excludes rows.
