### Optimization, Native in SQL

PackDB extends DuckDB with declarative optimization.  
Select optimal subsets of data with constraints and objectives — no external tools required.

  
  



  


## Quick Example

```sql
SELECT item, value, weight, x AS selected
FROM Items
DECIDE x IS BOOLEAN
SUCH THAT
    SUM(x * weight) <= 50
MAXIMIZE SUM(x * value);
```

## Why PackDB?

- **Native SQL** — Express optimization as a SQL extension. No context switching between your database and an external solver.
- **Zero Data Movement** — Solve directly on database buffers. No export/import overhead.
- **Declarative** — Define *what* to optimize, not *how*. The system handles ILP formulation automatically.
- **Built on DuckDB** — Columnar storage, vectorized execution, and an embedded [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/) solver. Optional [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) support for commercial workloads.

## DECIDE Syntax

```sql
SELECT select_list
FROM table_expression
[WHERE ...]
DECIDE variable_name [IS type] [, ...]
SUCH THAT constraint [AND constraint ...]
[MAXIMIZE | MINIMIZE] SUM|MIN|MAX(linear_expression)
```


| Feature                  | Details                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Variable types**       | `IS BOOLEAN` (0/1), `IS INTEGER` (non-negative, default), `IS REAL` (continuous) |
| **Constraint operators** | `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `<>`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`                                 |
| **Aggregates**           | `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`                                    |
| **Conditional**          | `expression WHEN condition` (postfix)                                            |
| **Grouping**             | `SUM(expr) op rhs PER column` — one constraint per distinct group                |

## Building from Source

PackDB requires [CMake](https://cmake.org), Python3, and a C++11 compliant compiler.

```bash
make release
```

Build output:

- **CLI**: `build/release/packdb`
- **Library**: `build/release/src/libduckdb.so`

## Running Tests

```bash
make decide-test       # Run DECIDE differential tests
make decide-setup      # Setup test environment only
```

Tests are located in `[test/decide/](test/decide/)`.

## Example Problem Domains

PackDB can express a wide range of optimization problems directly in SQL:

- **Knapsack / Packing** — Maximize value within weight or budget limits
- **Diet / Nutrition** — Meet nutritional targets while minimizing cost
- **Portfolio Selection** — Maximize return under risk constraints
- **Resource Allocation** — Assign limited resources to maximize output
- **Production Planning** — Optimize production quantities with capacity constraints
- **Assignment** — Assign items to resources optimally
- **Scheduling** — Complex constraint satisfaction over time slots
- **Multi-period Optimization** — Time-indexed decision problems with carry-over constraints
