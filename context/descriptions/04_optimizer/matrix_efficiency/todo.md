# Matrix Efficiency — Todo

Optimizations that make the ILP matrix smaller, tighter, or safer to solve.

## 1. Constraint-to-Bound Conversion

**Priority**: Medium

**Motivation**: Many user-written constraints are equivalent to simple variable bounds (e.g., `SUM(x) <= 10` when there's only one row, or `x <= 5` as a per-row constraint on a single variable). Solvers handle bounds much more efficiently than matrix constraints — bounds are O(1) per variable, while each matrix constraint adds a row to the LP tableau.

**Detection rules**:
- `x <= K` (single variable, no coefficient or coefficient = 1) → upper bound on x
- `x >= K` (single variable) → lower bound on x
- `x = K` (single variable) → fixed variable
- Only when the constraint applies to **all rows** (no WHEN or PER modifier), otherwise it's a conditional constraint that can't be expressed as a simple bound

**Implementation approach**:
1. After binding, scan constraints for single-variable patterns
2. Extract bound information and apply directly to `SolverInput` variable bounds
3. Remove the constraint from the matrix
4. Handle interactions: if multiple constraints bound the same variable, take the tightest

**Benefit**: Reduces matrix rows (fewer constraints for solver to process) and improves solver numerical stability.

## 2. Solver Time Limit

**Priority**: High

**Motivation**: Currently neither Gurobi nor HiGHS backend configures a timeout. Both run with library defaults (no explicit time bound). For large ILPs, this means a query can hang indefinitely. A configurable timeout ensures queries return within a predictable time, potentially with a sub-optimal but feasible solution.

**Current state**: `adaptive_processing/done.md` (old docs) previously incorrectly stated a 60-second default was implemented. **Verified as inaccurate** — no timeout is set in either backend.

**Implementation**:
- Gurobi: `GRBsetdblparam(env, GRB_DBL_PAR_TIMELIMIT, seconds)` before `GRBoptimize()`
- HiGHS: `highs.setOptionValue("time_limit", seconds)` before `highs.run()`
- Configurable via DuckDB SET variable: `SET decide_timeout = 60` (seconds)
- Pass timeout value through `SolverInput` to solver backends
- Default: 60 seconds (matches typical interactive query expectations)
- Both solvers return the best feasible solution found when timeout is reached (with a status indicating optimality was not proven)

**Code locations to modify**:
- `src/packdb/gurobi/gurobi_solver.cpp` — add `GRBsetdblparam` call
- `src/packdb/naive/deterministic_naive.cpp` — add `highs.setOptionValue("time_limit", ...)` call
- `src/execution/operator/decide/physical_decide.cpp` — read SET variable, pass to `SolverInput`
