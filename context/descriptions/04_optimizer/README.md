# PackDB COP Optimizer

This folder documents the optimization strategies for Constrained Optimization Problem (COP) queries — the DECIDE clause portion of PackDB. Each area is a **subfolder** with:

- `done.md` — What is implemented today, with code pointers
- `todo.md` — What remains to be built, with design rationale and implementation suggestions

---

## Capstone Priorities

| Priority | Area | Folder | Goal |
|----------|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Matrix efficiency | [matrix_efficiency/](matrix_efficiency/) | Make ILPs smaller and safer (bound conversion, solver timeout) |
| 2 | Partition-solve | [partition_solve/](partition_solve/) | Decompose PER queries into independent sub-ILPs |
| 3 | Rewrite passes | [rewrite_passes/](rewrite_passes/) | Push-down, pull-out, migrate binder rewrites to optimizer |

---

## All Folders

| Folder | done.md | todo.md |
|--------|---------|---------|
| [existing_optimizations/](existing_optimizations/) | WHERE filtering, WHEN zeroing, solver selection, binder algebraic rewrites (COUNT/AVG/ABS/MIN/MAX/`<>`/IN), DecideOptimizer pass | *(none — reference only)* |
| [matrix_efficiency/](matrix_efficiency/) | No matrix-level optimizations yet | Constraint-to-bound conversion, solver time limit |
| [partition_solve/](partition_solve/) | `row_group_ids` foundation from PER | PER decomposition into K independent ILPs |
| [rewrite_passes/](rewrite_passes/) | Current binder + optimizer rewrite locations | Push-down, pull-out, binder-to-optimizer migration |
| [future_work/](future_work/) | *(none)* | Skyband, Progressive Shading, LGS, LP relaxation, cuts, symmetry breaking, softening, hardening, incremental reasoning, cost-based selection, bound tightening |
