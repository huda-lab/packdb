# Parser & Symbolic Layer

## 1. Overview
The Parser and Symbolic Layer is the entry point for the `DECIDE` clause. Its primary responsibility is not just to build a parse tree, but to **normalize** the user's algebraic expressions into a canonical form that the system can optimize. This is a critical step because SQL allows flexible expression shapes (e.g., `x * 2 + 5`), whereas linear solvers require a strict `coeff * variable` structure.

**Key Source File**: `src/packdb/symbolic/decide_symbolic.cpp`

## 2. Symbolic Translation

> **Note on IN/BETWEEN**: `IN` and `BETWEEN` are handled as symbolic predicate types during parsing. The symbolic layer passes them through unchanged — they are validated or rejected at the binder stage, not during normalization. In particular, `IN` on decision variables is explicitly rejected by the binder with a clear error message.

PackDB integrates `SymbolicC++` to perform algebraic manipulations. The translation pipeline is as follows:

1.  **DuckDB to Symbolic**: The `ToSymbolicRecursive` function traverses the DuckDB `ParsedExpression` tree.
    -   `ColumnRef` (decision variable) $\rightarrow$ `Symbolic Variable`
    -   `ColumnRef` (normal column) $\rightarrow$ `Symbolic Constant` (treated as opaque for now)
    -   `Operator` (+, -, *) $\rightarrow$ `Symbolic Operation`

2.  **Normalization**: The symbolic engine simplifies the expression. This involves:
    -   Expanding parentheses: `2 * (x + 5)` $\rightarrow$ `2x + 10`
    -   Collecting like terms: `x + x` $\rightarrow$ `2x`
    -   Separating constants.

3.  **Symbolic to DuckDB**: The `FromSymbolic` function converts the simplified symbolic expression back into a DuckDB `ParsedExpression`, structured specifically for the Binder.

## 3. Canonical Forms

The parser ensures that all constraints and objectives are rewritten into the following canonical forms before they reach the Binder.

### 3.1 Constraints
All constraints are normalized to:
$$ \sum (c_i \cdot x_i) \leq K - \sum (RowTerm_j) $$
Where:
-   $x_i$: Decision variables.
-   $c_i$: Coefficients (can be expressions).
-   $K$: A constant.
-   $RowTerm_j$: Terms involving only table columns (no decision variables).

**Example Transformation**:
Input SQL:
```sql
SUM(profit * x - cost) <= 500
```
Internal Steps:
1.  Symbolic: $\sum (P \cdot x - C) \leq 500$
2.  Split Sum: $\sum (P \cdot x) - \sum C \leq 500$
3.  Rearrange: $\sum (P \cdot x) \leq 500 + \sum C$

The Parser rewrites the expression tree so that the LHS contains **only** decision-dependent terms, and the RHS contains **only** scalar terms.

### 3.2 Objectives
Objectives are similarly normalized to:
$$ \text{MAX/MIN } \sum (c_i \cdot x_i) $$
Constant offsets in the objective (e.g., `MAX SUM(x * p + 10)`) are dropped from the optimization problem as they do not affect the optimal choice of $x$, though they are technically preserved in the final projection if needed.

## 4. Interaction with Binder
The Binder receives this normalized tree. It no longer needs to perform algebraic rearrangement; it simply validates that the structure matches the expectation (linear sum on LHS, scalar on RHS) and binds the column references.

## 5. `WHEN` Keyword (Conditional Constraints)

The parser handles the `WHEN` postfix keyword for conditional constraints via a DECIDE-scoped grammar rule. WHEN is **not** added to the global `a_expr` production (which would conflict with `CASE expr WHEN`), but instead lives in a dedicated `decide_constraint_item` non-terminal:

```yacc
decide_constraint_item:
    a_expr WHEN a_expr    /* constraint WHEN condition */
    | a_expr              /* unconditional constraint */
    ;
```

The parser emits a `PG_AEXPR_WHEN_CONSTRAINT` node, which the transformer converts to a `FunctionExpression("__when_constraint__", [constraint, condition])`. The symbolic layer normalizes the constraint child while passing through the condition unchanged.

> **Note on normalization with wrappers**: Normalization passes through PER and WHEN wrappers unchanged — only the inner constraint expression is normalized. The wrapper functions (`__per_constraint__`, `__when_constraint__`) are preserved as-is around the normalized child.

## 6. `PER` Keyword (Grouped Constraints)

The `PER` keyword uses a similar grammar scoping approach as `WHEN`. It lives in the same `decide_constraint_item` non-terminal rather than the global `a_expr` production:

```yacc
decide_constraint_item:
    a_expr PER a_expr WHEN a_expr    /* constraint PER column WHEN condition */
    | a_expr PER a_expr              /* constraint PER column */
    | a_expr WHEN a_expr             /* constraint WHEN condition */
    | a_expr                         /* unconditional constraint */
    ;
```

The parser emits a `PG_AEXPR_PER_CONSTRAINT` node (analogous to `PG_AEXPR_WHEN_CONSTRAINT`), which the transformer converts to a `FunctionExpression("__per_constraint__", [constraint, per_column])`.

The symbolic layer normalizes the constraint child while passing through the PER column unchanged.

**Combined PER+WHEN**: When both keywords are present, the wrapper nesting is `PER(WHEN(constraint, condition), per_column)`. The parser produces this nesting directly from the `a_expr PER a_expr WHEN a_expr` rule — PER wraps the outer layer, and WHEN wraps the inner constraint+condition pair.

## 7. Table-Scoped Decision Variables

Table-scoped (entity-scoped) decision variables use a qualified `table.variable` syntax, parsed via a dedicated grammar rule in `select.y`:

```yacc
ColId '.' ColId IS variable_type
```

When the parser encounters a dotted name in the `DECIDE` clause (e.g., `DECIDE drivers.assigned IS BOOLEAN`), it produces a qualified `PGColumnRef` with a two-part name list — the first part is the table alias, the second is the variable name. This is the same `PGColumnRef` structure DuckDB uses for qualified column references (e.g., `t.col`), so no new AST node types are required.

The symbolic layer treats the qualified variable name as an opaque identifier during normalization, preserving the table prefix through algebraic simplification. The binder (not the parser) is responsible for resolving the table alias and validating that the referenced table exists in the query's bind context.
