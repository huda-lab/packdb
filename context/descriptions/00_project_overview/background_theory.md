# Theoretical Background

## 1. The "Unbundling" Problem
In traditional data analysis pipelines involving optimization, there is a fundamental disconnect known as "Unbundling".
-   **Data Management**: Handled by DBMS (SQL). Efficient at storage, retrieval, filtering.
-   **Decision Logic**: Handled by Solvers (OR tools). Efficient at searching solution spaces.
-   **The Gap**: To solve a problem, data must be unbundled from the database, transported to the application, and re-bundled into the solver's format. This creates latency, consistency risks, and engineering complexity.

## 2. Package Queries
The concept of "Package Queries" was formalized by generic Package Query Language (PQL) research (Brucato et al.).
-   **Definition**: A query that returns a *package* (subset of tuples) that collectively satisfy global constraints.
-   **Contrast**: Standard SQL `WHERE` clauses apply predicates to *individual* tuples independently. `DECIDE` clauses apply predicates to the *collection* of selected tuples.

## 3. Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
PackDB maps these queries to ILP problems.
-   **Canonical Form**:
    $$ \text{maximize } \mathbf{c}^T \mathbf{x} $$
    $$ \text{subject to } A \mathbf{x} \le \mathbf{b} $$
    $$ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^n $$
-   **Mapping**:
    -   $\mathbf{x}$: The decision variables (one per row).
    -   $\mathbf{c}$: The coefficients of the objective function (derived from row values).
    -   $A, \mathbf{b}$: The constraint matrix and bounds.

## 4. Why DuckDB + Gurobi/HiGHS?
-   **DuckDB**: Columnar, vectorized execution makes it fast to compute the coefficients ($\mathbf{c}$ and $A$) over large datasets.
-   **Gurobi**: A state-of-the-art commercial solver with excellent performance on large-scale mixed-integer problems. Used as the primary solver when a license is available.
-   **HiGHS**: A modern, open-source C++ solver bundled as the fallback. Embedding it creates a zero-copy (or near zero-copy) path from DB memory to Solver memory, ensuring PackDB works out of the box without any commercial dependencies.
