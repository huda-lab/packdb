# Bilinear Term Test Coverage — Done

Tests live in `test/decide/tests/test_bilinear.py` plus interactions in
`test_aggregate_local_when.py` and `test_quadratic_constraints.py`.

Bilinear terms (`x * y`, two different DECIDE variables) split into two
categories:

1. **Boolean × anything**: exact MILP via McCormick envelopes, works with both
   solvers. Bool × Bool uses simpler AND-linearization.
2. **General non-convex** (Real×Real, Int×Int, Int×Real): Q matrix off-diagonal
   entries, Gurobi only (NonConvex=2).
