# Entity-Scope Test Coverage — Done

Tests live in `test/decide/tests/test_entity_scope.py`.

Tests marked ✓ compare PackDB's output against an independently-formulated
gurobipy ILP via `compare_solutions` (objective + decision vector). Tests
marked (constraint only) verify feasibility but not optimality — a legacy
tier per `05_testing/README.md`; new tests in this area should move to
oracle-verified.

| `test_entity_scoped_mixed_when_per` | All-four: entity + row-scoped + WHEN + PER | ✓ (Gurobi-only; fixture skips on HiGHS-only hosts) |
| `test_entity_scoped_when_on_objective` | WHEN on objective + entity-scoped | ✓ |
| `test_entity_scoped_multi_column_per` | Multi-column PER (region × segment) + entity-scoped | ✓ |

| `test_entity_scoped_avg_per` | AVG + PER + entity-scoped | ✓ |
| `test_entity_scoped_ne_per` | NE + PER + entity-scoped, oracle via `add_ne_indicator` per region | ✓ |

| `test_entity_scoped_two_tables` | Two entity-scoped vars from different tables (n + r) | ✓ |
| `test_entity_scoped_var_in_when_condition_error` | Error: DECIDE var in WHEN condition | — (error test) |
| `test_entity_scoped_when_entity_invisible` | WHEN filters all rows for some entities | ✓ |

| `test_row_scoped_vars_on_fanout_join` | Row-scoped (non-entity) vars on 1-to-many orders×lineitem JOIN — baseline contrast | ✓ |

| `test_entity_scoped_three_way_join_per_region` | customer × nation × region fan-out, entity variable on nation, PER on outer-table column | ✓ |
| `test_entity_scoped_over_subquery_of_base_table` | Regression: `FROM (SELECT ... FROM base) t DECIDE t.x ...` — used to silently collapse to one entity because child bindings were read after CreatePlan moved projection expressions out (`plan_decide.cpp`) | ✓ |
| `test_entity_scoped_over_cte_of_base_table` | Same regression shape via WITH-CTE | ✓ |
| `test_entity_scoped_vs_per_null_semantics` | Side-by-side divergence: entity-scope collapses NULL keys into one shared entity; PER excludes NULL-keyed rows from groups (rows float free of the cap) | ✓ |
