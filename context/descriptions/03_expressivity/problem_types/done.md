# Problem Types — Implemented Features

PackDB can express several classes of mathematical optimization problems. The problem class is determined automatically by the combination of variable types declared in `DECIDE` and the form of the objective expression. This page catalogs the supported problem classes from a mathematical optimization perspective — for syntax details, see the per-keyword done.md files.

## Supported Problem Classes

### LP (Linear Programming)

All variables declared `IS REAL`, with a linear objective and linear constraints.

Standard form: minimize c^T x, subject to Ax <= b, x >= 0

```sql
SELECT id, ROUND(x, 2) FROM data
DECIDE x IS REAL
SUCH THAT x <= 100 AND SUM(x) >= 500
MINIMIZE SUM(x * cost)
```

Supported by both Gurobi and HiGHS.

### ILP (Integer Linear Programming)

All variables declared `IS INTEGER` and/or `IS BOOLEAN`, with a linear objective and linear constraints. This is the **default** problem class — `DECIDE x` without a type annotation defaults to `IS INTEGER`.

Standard form: minimize c^T x, subject to Ax <= b, x in Z^n_+

```sql
SELECT * FROM items
DECIDE keep IS BOOLEAN
SUCH THAT SUM(keep * weight) <= 50
MAXIMIZE SUM(keep * value)
```

Supported by both Gurobi and HiGHS.

### MILP (Mixed-Integer Linear Programming)

Mix of `IS REAL` + `IS INTEGER`/`IS BOOLEAN` variables, with a linear objective and linear constraints. Arises when a query needs both selection (BOOLEAN) and value-assignment (REAL).

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
DECIDE selected IS BOOLEAN, new_salary IS REAL
SUCH THAT selected <= 1 AND new_salary <= max_salary AND SUM(new_salary) <= budget
MAXIMIZE SUM(selected * performance)
```

Supported by both Gurobi and HiGHS.

### QP (Quadratic Programming)

All variables declared `IS REAL` (continuous), with a quadratic objective and linear constraints.

Standard form: minimize (1/2) x^T Q x + c^T x, subject to Ax <= b, x >= 0

**Convex QP** (MINIMIZE with PSD Q, or MAXIMIZE with NSD Q): Supported by both Gurobi and HiGHS.

```sql
-- MINIMIZE convex: Q is PSD (standard)
SELECT id, ROUND(x, 2) FROM data
DECIDE x IS REAL
SUCH THAT x >= 0 AND x <= 100
MINIMIZE SUM(POWER(x - target, 2))

-- MAXIMIZE concave (negated quadratic): Q is NSD, both solvers handle natively
SELECT id, ROUND(x, 2) FROM data
DECIDE x IS REAL
SUCH THAT x >= 0 AND x <= 100
MAXIMIZE SUM(-POWER(x - target, 2))
```

**Non-convex QP** (MAXIMIZE with PSD Q): **Gurobi only** — requires spatial branching (NonConvex=2). HiGHS rejects with an error. NP-hard even for continuous variables.

```sql
-- MAXIMIZE convex: push x to boundary (maximum squared deviation)
SELECT id, ROUND(x, 2) FROM data
DECIDE x IS REAL
SUCH THAT x >= 0 AND x <= 10
MAXIMIZE SUM(POWER(x - 5, 2))
```

### MIQP (Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming)

Mix of `IS REAL` + `IS INTEGER`/`IS BOOLEAN` variables, with a quadratic objective and linear constraints. Arises when combining selection (BOOLEAN) with least-squares fitting (REAL).

**Gurobi only** — HiGHS rejects MIQP with an error directing the user to either install Gurobi or use `IS REAL` variables.

```sql
SELECT * FROM measurements
DECIDE keep IS BOOLEAN, repaired IS REAL
SUCH THAT repaired >= 0 AND repaired <= 100 AND SUM(keep) >= 10
MINIMIZE SUM(POWER(repaired - measured, 2))
```

### Mixed Linear + Quadratic Objective

Linear terms may appear alongside a `POWER(...)` term in the same objective, either within a single `SUM` or across sibling `SUM`s. The quadratic part populates the Q matrix; the linear part populates the c vector. Both are emitted from the objective extraction layer simultaneously and composed by the solver.

```sql
-- Linear regularisation on top of least-squares
SELECT * FROM data
DECIDE x IS REAL
SUCH THAT x >= 0 AND x <= 100
MINIMIZE SUM(POWER(x - target, 2) + penalty * x)

-- Equivalent form (sibling SUMs) — produces the same solver input
MINIMIZE SUM(POWER(x - target, 2)) + SUM(penalty * x)
```

Optimum of `SUM(POWER(x - t, 2) + c * x)` with no other binding constraints is `x = t - c/2` (clipped to bounds).

**Restriction — single quadratic group per objective.** Only one `POWER(...)` / `(expr)*(expr)` self-product may appear in an objective (plus arbitrarily many linear siblings). Multiple quadratic groups (e.g., `SUM(POWER(x, 2)) + SUM(POWER(y, 2))`) are rejected with a clear error because the objective-side Q matrix is built from a single inner linear expression. Constraints don't have this restriction — they carry `quadratic_groups` per group.

### Bilinear Programming (Boolean × Anything — McCormick Linearization)

When one factor in a product of two different DECIDE variables is declared `IS BOOLEAN`, the product `b * x` is exactly linearized using McCormick envelopes. This produces an equivalent MILP reformulation — no relaxation, exact for binary variables. Works with both Gurobi and HiGHS.

**Requires**: A finite upper bound on the non-Boolean variable (`x <= K`). Bool×Bool uses simpler AND-linearization (no Big-M needed).

```sql
-- Boolean x Real objective (both solvers)
SELECT * FROM items
DECIDE b IS BOOLEAN, x IS REAL
SUCH THAT x <= 100 AND SUM(b) <= 5
MAXIMIZE SUM(b * x)

-- Boolean x Boolean objective (both solvers)
SELECT * FROM tasks
DECIDE b1 IS BOOLEAN, b2 IS BOOLEAN
SUCH THAT SUM(b1) <= 3 AND SUM(b2) <= 3
MAXIMIZE SUM(b1 * b2)

-- With data coefficient
MAXIMIZE SUM(profit * b * x)
```

### Non-Convex Bilinear Programming (Q Matrix, Gurobi Only)

When neither factor is Boolean (`Real×Real`, `Int×Int`, `Int×Real`), the product produces off-diagonal entries in the Q matrix. This is always indefinite (non-convex).

- **Objectives**: Gurobi only (via `NonConvex=2`). HiGHS rejects with a clear error.
- **Constraints**: Gurobi only (via `GRBaddqconstr`). HiGHS rejects with a clear error.

```sql
-- Real x Real objective (Gurobi only)
SELECT * FROM data
DECIDE x IS REAL, y IS REAL
SUCH THAT x <= 10 AND y <= 10
MINIMIZE SUM(x * y)

-- Bilinear in constraints (Gurobi only)
SUCH THAT SUM(x * y) <= 100
```

### Feasibility Problems (No Objective)

Any combination of variable types, with constraints but **no** `MAXIMIZE`/`MINIMIZE` clause. The solver finds any feasible assignment satisfying all constraints. The `DecideSense::FEASIBILITY` enum value is used internally; the model builder sets all objective coefficients to zero.

```sql
SELECT * FROM shifts
DECIDE assigned IS BOOLEAN
SUCH THAT SUM(assigned) >= 3 PER day AND SUM(assigned) <= 5 PER employee
```

Supported by both Gurobi and HiGHS.

### QCQP (Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming)

Quadratic terms (`POWER(linear_expr, 2)`) are supported in `SUCH THAT` constraints, enabling QCQP. The constraint takes the form `SUM(POWER(expr, 2)) <= K` or per-row `POWER(expr, 2) <= K`.

**Gurobi only** — HiGHS does not support quadratic constraints and rejects with a clear error.

```sql
-- Aggregate quadratic constraint: total squared deviation budget
SELECT id, ROUND(x, 2) FROM data
DECIDE x IS REAL
SUCH THAT x >= 0 AND x <= 100
    AND SUM(POWER(x - target, 2)) <= 1000
MAXIMIZE SUM(x)

-- Per-row quadratic constraint
SUCH THAT POWER(x - target, 2) <= 9

-- QCQP: quadratic in both objective and constraint
MINIMIZE SUM(POWER(x - preferred, 2))
SUCH THAT SUM(POWER(x - required, 2)) <= 50
```

All syntax forms supported: `POWER(expr, 2)`, `expr ** 2`, `(expr) * (expr)` self-product. Negated and scaled forms also supported: `-POWER(expr, 2)`, `K * POWER(expr, 2)`.

Composes with WHEN, PER, and linear constraints. Multiple quadratic constraints per query are supported.

## How Problem Class Is Determined

The user does not declare a problem class. PackDB infers it from the variable types and objective form:

| Variable Types | Objective | Problem Class |
|---|---|---|
| All BOOLEAN/INTEGER | Linear or none | ILP |
| All REAL | Linear or none | LP |
| Mix of REAL + INTEGER/BOOLEAN | Linear or none | MILP |
| All REAL | Convex quadratic | QP |
| All REAL | Non-convex quadratic (`MAXIMIZE SUM(POWER)`) | Non-convex QP (Gurobi only) |
| Mix of REAL + INTEGER/BOOLEAN | Quadratic | MIQP (Gurobi only) |
| Any (one factor BOOLEAN) | Bilinear (`b * x`) | MILP (McCormick, both solvers) |
| Any (no BOOLEAN factor) | Bilinear (`x * y`) | Non-convex QP (Gurobi only) |
| Any | Linear/quadratic, with `POWER(expr,2)` constraints | QCQP (Gurobi only) |
| Any | None (feasibility) | Feasibility |

The model builder sets `is_integer`, `is_binary`, `has_quadratic_objective`, and `nonconvex_quadratic` flags accordingly, and the solver backend handles the appropriate formulation.

## Key Structural Properties

### Constraints

Constraints are primarily linear. Products of two decision variables (`x * y`) and quadratic terms (`POWER(expr, 2)`) are also supported:

- **Boolean × anything**: Exactly linearized via McCormick envelopes (both solvers). The bilinear product is replaced with auxiliary variables and linear constraints at optimizer time, so the feasible region remains a convex polytope.
- **General non-convex bilinear** (`Real×Real`, `Int×Int`, `Int×Real`): Gurobi only, via `GRBaddqconstr`. HiGHS rejects with a clear error.
- **Quadratic constraints** (`POWER(expr, 2)` in SUCH THAT): Gurobi only, via `GRBaddqconstr`. Each `POWER(inner_expr, 2)` is expanded into Q = sign * A^T A (outer product of inner expression coefficients). Multiple quadratic groups per constraint are accumulated. Constant terms from the inner expression are moved to the RHS. Composes with WHEN, PER, and linear terms in the same constraint.

### Quadratic Objectives — Convexity and Sign

Supported quadratic forms:

- `MINIMIZE SUM(POWER(linear_expr, 2))` — convex QP (Q = A^T A, PSD). Both solvers.
- `MAXIMIZE SUM(-POWER(linear_expr, 2))` — concave MAXIMIZE (Q = -A^T A, NSD). Both solvers handle natively (HiGHS internally flips sign+sense).
- `MAXIMIZE SUM(POWER(linear_expr, 2))` — non-convex (Gurobi only, via NonConvex=2). NP-hard.

The following are rejected:

- `MINIMIZE SUM(POWER(x, 3))` — only exponent 2 is supported
- **Total degree > 2** in decision variables — the detector rejects products whose combined degree exceeds 2, even when each factor individually matches a supported pattern. Concretely:
  - `SUM(POWER(x, 2) * POWER(x, 2))` (= x⁴): self-product of a squared expression. Rejected with "self-product of a non-linear expression".
  - `SUM(POWER(x, 2) * POWER(y, 2))` (= x²y²): product of two quadratics. Rejected with "degree > 2".
  - `SUM(a * POWER(x, 2))` where `a` is a DECIDE variable (= a·x²): variable multiplied by a quadratic. Rejected with "degree > 2".
  - `SUM(POWER(POWER(x, 2), 2))` (= x⁴): POWER of a non-linear inner. Rejected with "non-linear expression inside POWER".
  - Same rejections apply inside `SUCH THAT` (quadratic constraints).

### Bilinear Objectives

Products of two different DECIDE variables in objectives:

- **Boolean × anything** (`SUM(b * x)`): McCormick linearization produces an equivalent MILP. Both solvers. Requires a finite upper bound on the non-Boolean variable. Bool×Bool uses simpler AND-linearization (no Big-M).
- **General non-convex** (`SUM(x * y)` where neither is Boolean): Off-diagonal Q matrix entries (always indefinite). Gurobi only (NonConvex=2). HiGHS rejects.
- **Mixed objectives**: Linear + bilinear (`SUM(cost + b*x)`), bilinear + quadratic (`SUM(POWER(x-t,2) + b*x)`), and data coefficients (`SUM(profit * b * x)`) are all supported.

**Syntax forms** (all equivalent for positive quadratic):

```sql
MINIMIZE SUM(POWER(x - target, 2))         -- POWER function
MINIMIZE SUM((x - target) ** 2)             -- ** operator
MINIMIZE SUM((x - target) * (x - target))   -- explicit self-multiplication
```

**Negated syntax forms** (all equivalent for negative quadratic):

```sql
MAXIMIZE SUM(-POWER(x - target, 2))        -- negation outside POWER
MAXIMIZE SUM(-1 * POWER(x - target, 2))    -- explicit -1 multiplication
```

**Mathematical formulation**: The objective `SUM(sign * POWER(a1*x + a2*y + c, 2))` is expanded into the standard QP form `(1/2) x^T Q x + c^T x` where:
- Q is built from the outer product of the inner linear expression's coefficients: Q[i,j] = sign * 2*a_i*a_j summed over rows (factor of 2 due to the (1/2) x^T Q x convention)
- Linear terms arise from constant parts of the inner expression (cross terms: sign * 2*c*a_i)
- sign = +1.0 for positive quadratic, sign = -1.0 for negated quadratic
- The Q matrix is stored in COO (Coordinate) format in `SolverModel`, then converted to CSC for HiGHS

### All Variables Are Non-Negative

All variable types have a default lower bound of 0:
- BOOLEAN: [0, 1]
- INTEGER: [0, 1e30]
- REAL: [0, 1e30]

PackDB cannot currently express problems requiring negative variable values (see [todo.md](todo.md)).

### Big-M Linearization Is Transparent

Several constructs (`<>`, `IN` on decision variables, `COUNT` on INTEGER, hard `MIN`/`MAX` cases) use Big-M linearization internally. From the problem classification perspective, these remain linear — they add auxiliary binary variables and constraints but do not change the user-visible problem class (though an LP with Big-M becomes a MILP internally due to the auxiliary binaries).

## Code Pointers

- **Variable type -> solver flags**: `src/packdb/utility/ilp_model_builder.cpp`
  - DOUBLE/FLOAT -> `is_integer=false`, BOOLEAN -> `is_binary=true`, INTEGER -> `is_integer=true`
  - These flags determine whether the solver treats the problem as LP, ILP, or MILP

- **Quadratic objective detection**: `src/execution/operator/decide/physical_decide.cpp`
  - `PhysicalDecide::DetectQuadraticPattern` (member, invoked from `ExtractLinearAndBilinearTerms` at every additive node) matches `POWER(expr, 2)`, `(expr) * (expr)` self-product, and negated / constant-scaled forms. Returns `{inner_linear_expr, sign}`.
  - Extracts inner linear expression terms into `Objective::squared_terms` with `quadratic_sign` (scalar; sign combines negation and constant scaling).
  - **Degree guard**: `PhysicalDecide::IsLinearInDecideVars` is invoked on the inner of every POWER / self-product pattern and on each side of a bilinear `*`. Inputs whose total decision-variable degree would exceed 2 (e.g. `POWER(x,2)*POWER(x,2)`, `POWER(x,2)*POWER(y,2)`, `a*POWER(x,2)`, `POWER(POWER(x,2),2)`) are rejected with a clear `InvalidInputException` rather than silently misclassified as a lower-degree Q term. Same guard runs in the constraint path (`TryDetectConstraintQuadratic` and the constraint bilinear branch).

- **Q matrix construction**: `src/packdb/utility/ilp_model_builder.cpp`
  - Builds Q from outer products of per-row inner expression coefficients: Q = sign * A^T A
  - sign = +1.0 produces PSD Q (convex), sign = -1.0 produces NSD Q (concave)
  - Sets `nonconvex_quadratic` flag based on sign+sense combination
  - Handles constant-term cross-contributions to linear objective (also sign-adjusted)

- **Gurobi QP**: `src/packdb/gurobi/gurobi_solver.cpp` — calls `GRBaddqpterms` for Q matrix; sets `NonConvex=2` when `nonconvex_quadratic` is true

- **HiGHS QP**: `src/packdb/naive/deterministic_naive.cpp` — calls `passHessian` with COO->CSC conversion; rejects non-convex QP and MIQP with errors

- **Solver dispatch**: `src/packdb/utility/ilp_solver.cpp`
  - `SolverModel::Build()` constructs the formulation; `SolveModel()` dispatches to Gurobi (if available) or HiGHS

- **Solver input (Q matrix storage)**: `src/include/duckdb/packdb/solver_input.hpp`
  - `quadratic_inner_coefficients`, `quadratic_inner_variable_indices`, `has_quadratic_objective`

- **SUM argument validation (QP + bilinear syntax)**: `src/planner/expression_binder/decide_binder.cpp`
  - `ValidateSumArgumentInternal` accepts `POWER(linear_expr, 2)`, `POW(linear_expr, 2)`, `(expr) * (expr)` where both sides are identical, and products of two different DECIDE variables (`x * y`) when `allow_bilinear` is true
  - Rejects `POWER(expr, N)` for N != 2, triple or higher products, non-constant exponents

- **Quadratic constraint extraction**: `src/execution/operator/decide/physical_decide.cpp`
  - `ExtractConstraintTerms` detects `POWER(expr, 2)`, `expr ** 2`, `(expr)*(expr)` self-products, and scaled forms
  - `TryDetectConstraintQuadratic` (local lambda) handles pattern matching for all syntax forms
  - Populates `DecideConstraint::QuadraticGroup` with inner linear terms and sign

- **Quadratic constraint Q matrix**: `src/packdb/utility/ilp_model_builder.cpp`
  - `BuildQuadraticConstraint` lambda builds `QuadraticConstraint` from `EvaluatedConstraint` quadratic groups
  - Computes outer product Q = sign * A^T A per group, accumulates into single Q matrix
  - Handles PER groups (one QuadraticConstraint per group), WHEN filtering, and per-row constraints

- **Feasibility support**: Grammar rule in `third_party/libpg_query/grammar/statements/select.y` accepts `DECIDE ... SUCH THAT ...` without objective. `DecideSense::FEASIBILITY` flows through parser → binder → physical → model builder. Model builder sets all objective coefficients to zero.

- **Symbolic normalization skip**: `src/packdb/symbolic/decide_symbolic.cpp`
  - `ComparisonLhsHasQuadraticOrBilinear` prevents symbolic expansion of POWER/bilinear structure

- **Bilinear implementation**: See [bilinear/done.md](../bilinear/done.md) for full implementation details including:
  - McCormick rewrite pass in optimizer (`RewriteBilinear`)
  - Boolean type tracking (`is_boolean_var` vector)
  - McCormick Big-M generation at execution time
  - Q matrix off-diagonal entries for non-Boolean bilinear
  - Quadratic constraints via `GRBaddqconstr`
