# DECIQL Expressivity Reference

This folder documents the expressive power of the DECIQL language — the SQL extension at the heart of PackDB. Each keyword/construct is a **subfolder** containing:

- `done.md` — What is implemented today, with syntax, examples, and code pointers
- `todo.md` — What remains to be built, with design rationale and implementation suggestions

### Problem Classification

For a complete taxonomy of what mathematical optimization problem classes PackDB can express (LP, ILP, MILP, QP, MIQP, feasibility), see [problem_types/done.md](problem_types/done.md).

## Development Priorities

All previously planned priorities are **done**:
1. ~~**IS REAL variables**~~ — done
2. ~~**AVG() aggregate**~~ — done (coefficient scaling)
3. ~~**ABS()**~~ — done (linearized via auxiliary variables)
4. ~~**`<>` and `IN` on decision variables**~~ — done (Big-M / auxiliary binary indicators)
5. ~~**COUNT() for INTEGER**~~ — done (Big-M indicator rewrite)
6. ~~**MIN() / MAX()**~~ — done (per-row + Big-M linearization)

7. ~~**Multi-column PER**~~ — done (`PER (col1, col2, ...)` with composite keys)

8. ~~**PER on objective**~~ — done (nested aggregate syntax with two-level auxiliary formulation)
9. ~~**Correlated subqueries**~~ — done (delegated to DuckDB's standard decorrelation; per-row constraints + scalar-RHS aggregate constraints)

**Remaining**:
- **Row-varying RHS with PER** — see [per/todo.md](per/todo.md)

## Background

DECIQL extends SQL with constrained optimization. The key structure:

```sql
SELECT select_list
FROM table_expression
[WHERE ...]
DECIDE [Table.]variable_name [IS type] [, ...]
SUCH THAT
    constraint [AND constraint ...]
[MAXIMIZE | MINIMIZE] objective_expression
```

See `context/descriptions/00_project_overview/syntax_reference.md` for the full implemented syntax reference.
