# SQL Functions & Expressions — Implemented Features

This file documents which SQL functions and expressions work inside DECIQL clauses today.

## Aggregate Functions

### SUM()

The primary aggregate over expressions involving decision variables. Valid in both constraints and objectives.

```sql
MAXIMIZE SUM(x * value)
SUCH THAT SUM(x * weight) <= 50
```

**Code**: Validated in `decide_objective_binder.cpp` and `decide_constraints_binder.cpp` — aggregates other than SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX are rejected with an error.

### AVG() — Coefficient Scaling at Execution Time

`AVG(expr)` over decision variables is treated as an aggregate constraint like SUM, but terms are scaled by the row count N at execution time so the model represents the average, not the raw sum.

**Semantics**: Standard SQL AVG — divide by count of all rows (decision variables are never NULL). This is always linear since N is a data-determined constant.

**Constraints**: Semantically, `AVG(expr) op K` is equivalent to `SUM(expr) op K*N` where N depends on context:
- No WHEN/PER: N = total row count
- WHEN: N = count of WHEN-matching rows
- PER: N = count of rows in each group
- WHEN+PER: N = count of WHEN-matching rows per group
- Aggregate-local WHEN: N = count of rows matching that aggregate-local filter, within each PER group if PER is present

**Objectives (flat)**: `MAXIMIZE/MINIMIZE AVG(expr)` uses the same optimal assignment as `SUM(expr)` when there is one global denominator. In mixed additive aggregate expressions, PackDB preserves AVG scaling per term so `AVG(a) + SUM(b)` is not treated as `SUM(a) + SUM(b)`.

**Objectives (nested PER)**: `OUTER(AVG(expr)) PER col` is fully supported. Inner AVG scales each row's coefficient by `1/n_g` (group size), producing true per-group averages. Outer AVG maps to SUM (dividing by constant G). See [maximize_minimize/done.md](../maximize_minimize/done.md).

```sql
SUCH THAT AVG(x * weight) <= 10         -- SUM(x*weight) <= 10*N
SUCH THAT AVG(x) <= 0.5                 -- at most half the rows selected (BOOLEAN)
SUCH THAT AVG(x * cost) <= 5 WHEN active -- only among active rows
SUCH THAT AVG(x * cost) WHEN active + SUM(x * fee) WHEN priority <= 100
SUCH THAT AVG(x * hours) <= 8 PER emp   -- per-group average
MAXIMIZE AVG(x * profit)                -- same as MAXIMIZE SUM(x * profit)
```

**Code**: AVG flows through binding natively (no parse-time rewrite), preserving its DOUBLE return type so fractional RHS values survive type coercion. The binders (`decide_constraints_binder.cpp`, `decide_objective_binder.cpp`) accept `"avg"` alongside `"sum"`. The `DecideOptimizer` rewrites AVG to SUM while tagging the aggregate with `AVG_REWRITE_TAG`. At execution time (`physical_decide.cpp`), expression analysis marks extracted terms with `avg_scale`; coefficient evaluation scales linear and bilinear terms by `1/N`, and quadratic inner terms by `1/sqrt(N)`. Exception: for `AVG(expr) <> K` the LHS scaling would produce fractional coefficients and trip the NE integer-step guard, so PackDB sets `EvaluatedConstraint::ne_avg_rhs_scale` and leaves the LHS as SUM; the deferred NE expansion multiplies the RHS by the per-group size instead.

**Tests**: `test/decide/tests/test_avg.py` — 11 test cases covering objectives, constraints, WHEN, PER, WHEN+PER, BOOLEAN, INTEGER, non-linear rejection, `<>` with and without WHEN, and no-decide-var passthrough.

### MIN() / MAX() — Per-Row and Big-M Indicator Rewrites

`MIN(expr)` and `MAX(expr)` over decision variables are supported in both SUCH THAT constraints and MAXIMIZE/MINIMIZE objectives. The implementation strategy depends on whether the case is "easy" (naturally per-row) or "hard" (requires Big-M indicator variables and a global auxiliary variable).

#### Easy Constraint Cases (No Big-M)

When the comparison direction already bounds each row individually, no auxiliary variables are needed:

- `MAX(expr) <= K` → per-row constraint: `expr <= K` for every row
- `MIN(expr) >= K` → per-row constraint: `expr >= K` for every row

These are trivially correct: bounding every row satisfies the aggregate bound. PER on easy cases is stripped (redundant, since constraints are already per-row).

#### Hard Constraint Cases (Big-M Indicators)

When the aggregate must be tight (equality or the "wrong" direction), a global auxiliary variable `z` and per-row binary indicators are introduced:

- `MAX(expr) >= K` → global variable `z >= K`, per-row: `z >= expr`, plus Big-M indicators ensuring `z` equals some row's value
- `MIN(expr) <= K` → global variable `z <= K`, per-row: `z <= expr`, plus Big-M indicators
- Equality cases (`MAX(expr) = K`, `MIN(expr) = K`) → both directions constrained

#### Objective Cases

- **Easy objectives**: `MINIMIZE MAX(expr)` and `MAXIMIZE MIN(expr)` — a single global auxiliary variable `z` with per-row linking constraints (`z >= expr_i` for MAX, `z <= expr_i` for MIN). The objective optimizes `z` directly.
- **Hard objectives**: `MAXIMIZE MAX(expr)` and `MINIMIZE MIN(expr)` — requires `z` plus per-row binary indicator variables to ensure `z` equals some row's actual value (Big-M formulation).

#### Composition

- **WHEN**: Composes naturally. WHEN masks filter which rows participate in the MIN/MAX aggregate, and constraint/indicator generation skips non-matching rows.
- **PER (easy cases)**: Stripped as redundant — easy cases already produce per-row constraints.

```sql
-- Easy constraint cases (no Big-M)
SUCH THAT MAX(x * cost) <= 100         -- per-row: x*cost <= 100
SUCH THAT MIN(x * hours) >= 2          -- per-row: x*hours >= 2

-- Hard constraint cases (Big-M indicators)
SUCH THAT MAX(x * cost) >= 50          -- global z, binary indicators
SUCH THAT MIN(x * hours) = 4           -- equality: both directions

-- Objectives
MINIMIZE MAX(x * cost)                 -- easy: global z, minimize
MAXIMIZE MIN(x * profit)               -- easy: global z, maximize
MAXIMIZE MAX(x * profit)               -- hard: z + binary indicators
MINIMIZE MIN(x * cost)                 -- hard: z + binary indicators

-- With WHEN
SUCH THAT MAX(x * cost) <= 50 WHEN category = 'electronics'
MINIMIZE MAX(x * deviation) WHEN active = 1
```

**Code**: The rewrite is performed by `DecideOptimizer::RewriteMinMaxConstraints` and `DecideOptimizer::RewriteMinMaxInConstraint` in `decide_optimizer.cpp`, which detect MIN/MAX aggregates and insert `__MIN__`/`__MAX__` marker tags into the symbolic representation. The binders (`decide_constraints_binder.cpp`, `decide_objective_binder.cpp`) whitelist MIN/MAX alongside SUM and AVG. The symbolic layer (`decide_symbolic.cpp`) recognizes the `__MIN__`/`__MAX__` markers. At execution time, `physical_decide.cpp` generates the appropriate per-row constraints, Big-M indicator constraints, and global auxiliary variables. Global variable and constraint support is provided by `solver_input.hpp` and `ilp_model_builder.cpp`.

## Rejected: Non-Linear Scalar Functions over a DECIDE Variable

Any scalar function other than `ABS()` and `POWER(..., 2)` that wraps a decision variable is rejected at bind time with:

```
Binder Error: Scalar function 'sqrt' over a DECIDE variable is not supported:
it would make the model non-linear. Only ABS() and POWER(..., 2) can wrap a
decision variable.
```

This covers (non-exhaustive) `SQRT`, `EXP`, `LN`, `LOG`, `FLOOR`, `CEIL`, `ROUND`, `SIN`, `COS`, `TAN`, and any user-defined or built-in scalar function that doesn't have a dedicated linearization path. The rejection fires in every position: per-row constraint LHS (`SUCH THAT sqrt(x) <= 2`), inside an aggregate (`SUM(exp(x))`, `MAXIMIZE SUM(log(x))`), and nested inside `ABS()` or `POWER()` (e.g., `ABS(sqrt(x) - 1)`).

**Scalar functions wrapping only table columns are not affected** — e.g., `SUM(x * sqrt(l_quantity))` would fold `sqrt(l_quantity)` into a per-row coefficient. The walker only flags a function when one of its arguments transitively contains a DECIDE variable.

**Aggregate mis-uses** (e.g., `BIT_AND(x)`, `STDDEV(x)`) are routed to the existing aggregate-specific rejection in `BindAggregate` with the more informative "only SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, or COUNT is allowed" message. A catalog lookup distinguishes scalar from aggregate so the two rejection paths don't collide.

**Why this guard exists**: before it, per-row non-linear scalars were silently stripped (`SUCH THAT sqrt(x) <= 2` returned `x = 2` instead of `x = 4`), aggregate non-linear scalars crashed the symbolic layer with `InternalException`, and `ABS(sqrt(x))` FATAL-ed the session at physical execution. The validator catches all three classes at bind time.

**Code**: `ValidateDecideNoNonLinearScalar` in `src/planner/expression_binder/decide_binder.cpp`, called from `src/planner/binder/query_node/bind_select_node.cpp` before `NormalizeDecideConstraints` / `NormalizeDecideObjective` (the pre-pass must run before symbolic normalization because the symbolic layer would otherwise throw on unknown functions).

**Tests**: `test/decide/tests/test_error_binder.py` — `test_nonlinear_scalar_per_row_lhs`, `test_nonlinear_scalar_inside_sum`, `test_nonlinear_scalar_inside_abs` (parametrized over SQRT, EXP, LN, LOG, FLOOR, CEIL, ROUND, SIN, COS).

**POWER exponent check**: The same pre-pass rejects `POWER(base, exp)` / `POW(base, exp)` / `base ** exp` when `base` contains a DECIDE variable and `exp` is not a constant numeric equal to `2`. That covers fractional exponents (`POWER(x, 0.5)`), negative exponents (`POWER(x, -1)`), higher-integer exponents (`POWER(x, 3)`), degenerate exponents (`POWER(x, 0)`, `POWER(x, 1)`), and non-constant exponents (`POWER(x, x)`, `POWER(x, col)`). Previously these tripped `InternalException: FromSymbolic: Non-integer exponents are not supported` during symbolic normalization (which happens before binding), exposing a C++ stack trace. The pre-pass now catches all non-2 cases with the same error messages used by the existing `ValidateQuadraticPower` whitelist inside SUM, so error-text tests stay consistent across SUM and non-SUM contexts.

**Known limitation (pre-existing, out of scope for this rejection)**: `SUM(f(col) * x)` where `f` is an arbitrary scalar function on a data column still trips the symbolic normalizer because `ToSymbolicRecursive` doesn't know those functions. Folding data-only scalar subtrees before normalization is a separate improvement; non-decide-var scalars are accepted by the validator but may fail later if they appear inside a SUM aggregate.

## ABS() — Linearized Automatically

`ABS(expr)` over decision variables is automatically linearized using the standard ILP technique. For each `ABS(expr)` that references a DECIDE variable, the system:

1. Introduces an auxiliary REAL variable `d` (hidden from query output)
2. Adds two constraints: `d >= expr` and `d >= -expr`
3. Replaces `ABS(expr)` with `d`

This works in both constraints and objectives:

```sql
-- In objectives: minimize total absolute deviation
MINIMIZE SUM(ABS(new_hours - hours))

-- In per-row constraints: bound deviation per row
SUCH THAT ABS(new_qty - l_quantity) <= 5

-- In aggregate constraints: bound total deviation
SUCH THAT SUM(ABS(new_qty - l_quantity)) <= 50
```

`ABS()` without decision variables (e.g., `ABS(col1 - col2)`) is left as regular SQL — no rewrite occurs.

**Code**: The rewrite is performed by `DecideOptimizer::RewriteAbs` in `decide_optimizer.cpp`. The binder binds ABS as a normal function; the optimizer detects it, creates auxiliary variables, and generates linearization constraints. Auxiliary variables are hidden from `SELECT *` by truncating the bind context.

**Tests**: `test/decide/tests/test_abs_linearization.py` — 8 test cases covering objectives, constraints, WHEN, PER, multiple ABS terms, no-decide-var, and mixed variable types.

## Arithmetic Operators

### Multiplication (`*`) — variable x constant or variable x column

```sql
x * 5              -- OK: variable * literal
x * weight         -- OK: variable * column (constant per row)
SUM(x * weight)    -- OK: aggregate of linear product
```

`x * y` (variable times variable) **is supported** as a bilinear term via `DecideOptimizer::RewriteBilinear` (McCormick envelopes when one factor is Boolean; non-convex Gurobi QCQP otherwise). `x * x` / `POWER(x, 2)` is supported as a quadratic (QP) term. See `03_expressivity/bilinear/done.md` and the Quadratic Objectives section of `syntax_reference.md` for solver eligibility.

### Addition / Subtraction (`+`, `-`)

```sql
x + y              -- OK: sum of variables
SUM(x * a + y * b) -- OK: linear combination in aggregate
```

### Division (`/`) by a constant or data column

`x / divisor` is supported in per-row constraints, aggregate constraints, and quadratic objectives (inside `POWER(..., 2)`) as long as the divisor doesn't contain a DECIDE variable. `x / y` between two decision variables is non-linear and rejected at bind time with a clear `Division by a DECIDE variable is not supported` error (previously silently accepted in the per-row path with nonsensical solutions). The divisor folds into the extracted coefficient — for `x / 2`, the solver sees `0.5 * x`; for `x / col`, the per-row coefficient is `1/col[row]`.

```sql
SUCH THAT x / 2 <= 1                       -- OK: equivalent to x <= 2
SUCH THAT SUM(x / weight) <= budget        -- OK: per-row scaled sum
MINIMIZE SUM(POWER(x / 2 - 1, 2))          -- OK: QP with division inside base
MINIMIZE SUM(POWER(x / weight - 1, 2))     -- OK: data-column divisor in QP
```

**Code**:
- Bind-time validation: `IsAllowedNameOverDecideVar` and the dedicated `/`-arm of `ValidateDecideNoNonLinearScalar` (per-row pre-pass) and `ValidateSumArgumentInternal` (SUM/POWER inner) in `src/planner/expression_binder/decide_binder.cpp` reject any `/` whose divisor contains a decide variable.
- Per-row extraction: `ExtractTerms` at `src/execution/operator/decide/physical_decide.cpp` walks `/` by recursing into the numerator and wrapping each emitted coefficient as `coef / divisor`.
- QP linearity check: `IsLinearInDecideVars` in the same file accepts `/` when the divisor is decide-var-free, so quadratic patterns like `POWER(x/2 - 1, 2)` reach the QP extractor.
- Symbolic normalization: `FromSymbolic` in `src/packdb/symbolic/decide_symbolic.cpp` recognises negative-integer Power exponents (which the symbolic library produces for `x / w` as `x * w^-1`) and rebuilds them as `1.0 / base^|k|`. Without this round-trip, `SUM(x / col)` would crash with `Non-integer exponents are not supported in DECIDE normalization`.

### Per-row linear LHS (`+ const`, `- col`, `/ const`, unary `-`)

Per-row constraints accept full linear shapes on the LHS, not just `x op K` and `c*x op K`. The extractor walks the LHS tree to separate decide-variable terms from constants and row-varying data columns; the latter are moved to the RHS per row so the solver sees an algebraically equivalent `sum(decide_terms) op adjusted_rhs` constraint.

```sql
SUCH THAT x + 3 <= 10          -- x <= 7
SUCH THAT x - ps_availqty <= 1 -- per row: x <= 1 + ps_availqty[row]
SUCH THAT -x <= -2             -- x >= 2
SUCH THAT 2 * x + 3 <= 11      -- x <= 4
SUCH THAT x / 2 + 1 <= 3       -- x <= 4
```

**Code**: `ExtractTerms` in `src/execution/operator/decide/physical_decide.cpp` handles `+`, `-` (binary and unary), `*`, `/` (divisor must be decide-var-free), and `CAST`. `ExtractConstraintTerms` delegates there. In `src/packdb/utility/ilp_model_builder.cpp`, the per-row constraint loop subtracts LHS terms whose `variable_index == INVALID_INDEX` (constants / row-data) from the per-row RHS instead of silently dropping them.

**Tests**: `test/decide/tests/test_cons_perrow.py` — `test_perrow_linear_lhs_upper_bound` (parametrized over `x+c`, `x-c`, `x/c`, `c*x+c`, `x/c+c`, `x+c-c`), `test_perrow_unary_minus_lower_bound`, `test_perrow_data_column_in_lhs`, all oracle-verified.

## Comparison Operators

### =, <, <=, >, >=

Six standard comparison operators are supported in constraints (including `<>`, documented below).

```sql
SUCH THAT x <= 1
SUCH THAT SUM(x * w) >= 10
SUCH THAT SUM(x) = 5
```

`<>` (not-equal) is supported on both per-row and aggregate constraints. It uses Big-M disjunction with an auxiliary binary indicator variable:

- `SUM(x) <> K` → two constraints: `SUM(x) <= K-1 + M*z` and `SUM(x) >= K+1 - M*(1-z)`
- `x <> K` → same pattern applied per-row

**Complexity**: Adds 1 binary variable and 2 constraints per `<>`. The Big-M value M is computed from variable bounds at execution time. Loose bounds produce weaker LP relaxations.

**Code**: Auxiliary indicator variable created by `DecideOptimizer::RewriteNotEqual` in `decide_optimizer.cpp`; Big-M constraints generated at execution time in `physical_decide.cpp` (`Finalize()`), where data bounds are available.

### BETWEEN ... AND ...

Desugars to `>= lower AND <= upper`. Produces two constraints.

```sql
SUCH THAT SUM(x) BETWEEN 10 AND 50
-- equivalent to: SUM(x) >= 10 AND SUM(x) <= 50
```

### IN (...)

Constrains a value to be in a literal set. Works on both table columns and decision variables.

```sql
SUCH THAT category IN ('A', 'B', 'C')   -- table column (SQL filter)
SUCH THAT x IN (0, 1, 3)                -- decision variable domain restriction
```

**Decision variable IN**: `x IN (v1, ..., vK)` is rewritten at bind time into K auxiliary binary indicator variables with two constraints:
- Cardinality: `z_1 + ... + z_K = 1` (exactly one value selected)
- Linking: `x = v1*z_1 + ... + vK*z_K` (x takes the selected value)

**Complexity**: Adds K binary variables and 2 constraints per IN. For small K (2–5 values) this is cheap. Large K (e.g., 100 values) adds significant model size — consider whether the domain can be expressed as a range constraint instead.

**Optimizations**:
- `x IN (0, 1)` on BOOLEAN → trivially satisfied, no rewrite
- `x IN (v)` single value → rewritten to `x = v`

**Code**: `bind_select_node.cpp` (`RewriteInDomain()`), called before constraint binding. IN on aggregates (e.g., `SUM(x) IN (...)`) remains unsupported.

---

## NULL-Related Expressions

### IS NULL / IS NOT NULL

Supported in WHEN conditions and WHERE clause (not over decision variables).

```sql
imputed_distance = distance WHEN distance IS NOT NULL AND
imputed_distance <= 10 WHEN (distance IS NULL AND mode = 'walk-bike')
```

---

## Boolean / Logical Operators

### AND — Two Roles

1. **Constraint separator** at the top level of `SUCH THAT`
2. **Logical AND** inside a `WHEN` condition (requires parentheses)

### OR

Valid in `WHEN` conditions and `WHERE` only. Not supported as a constraint combiner over decision variables (would create non-linear disjunctions).
