# /bench — Build, Benchmark, Analyze

Automates the PackDB optimization loop: build → benchmark → view → analyze → suggest.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` — space-separated, combinable:
- *(empty)* — build if needed, benchmark `--sizes medium`, auto-compare
- `full` — all sizes (small, medium, large)
- `small`, `medium`, `large`, or `small,medium` — specific sizes
- `manual` — run `queries/manual.sql`
- `compare` — explicitly force comparison with previous commit
- `skip-build` — skip `make release`

## Procedure

### 1. Parse arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` into:
- **sizes**: default `medium`. If `full`, use `small,medium,large`. If explicit sizes given, use those.
- **do_build**: default `true`. Set `false` if `skip-build` is present.
- **do_compare**: default `true`. Forced `true` if `compare` is present.
- **is_manual**: `true` if `manual` is present.

### 2. Build (unless skip-build)

Check if `build/release/packdb` exists and is older than the newest file under `src/`. If stale or missing, run:
```bash
make release
```
**STOP on build failure** — do not proceed to benchmarking.

If `skip-build` was specified, skip this step entirely.

### 3. Ensure databases exist

Check if the required database files exist under `benchmark/decide/databases/` (e.g., `small.db`). If any are missing, run:
```bash
make decide-bench-setup
```

### 4. Run benchmarks

Run with stage timers enabled:
```bash
PACKDB_BENCH=1 python3 benchmark/decide/run_benchmarks.py --sizes {sizes} [--compare] [--manual]
```

Add `--compare` if `do_compare` is true.
Add `--manual` if `is_manual` is true (omit `--sizes` for manual mode unless explicit sizes given).

### 5. View results

Run the visual viewer:
```bash
python3 benchmark/decide/view_results.py
```
(The benchmark runner already invokes this, but run it explicitly to capture the output for analysis.)

### 6. Analyze

Read the JSON result file from `benchmark/decide/results/` (the most recent one, or `manual.json` for manual mode).

For each query entry, compute:
- **Solver%**: `solver_ms / (wall_time_s * 1000) * 100`
- **Model%**: `model_construction_ms / (wall_time_s * 1000) * 100`
- **Optimizer%**: `optimizer_ms / (wall_time_s * 1000) * 100`

Present a summary table in this format:

```
## Benchmark Results (commit {hash}, {sizes})

| Query | Size | Rows | Vars | Constraints | Wall(s) | Solver% | Model% | Opt% |
|-------|------|------|------|-------------|---------|---------|--------|------|
| Q1    | small| 60K  | 60K  | 3           | 0.45    | 93%     | 5%     | 1%   |
```

### 7. Suggest next optimization

Study the benchmark profile holistically — stage percentages, variable/constraint counts, scaling across sizes, regressions vs previous results — and use your judgment to suggest the most impactful next move.

Consider factors like:
- Where time is actually spent (solver, model construction, optimizer)
- Whether variable/constraint counts seem proportional to the problem or inflated by auxiliary rewrites
- Scaling behavior across sizes if multiple were run
- Regressions vs previous commits if comparison data is available
- What the query's DECIDE clause actually does (read the SQL) and whether the formulation could be tighter

Point to specific files and code paths in your suggestions. Be concrete and actionable, not generic.

For each suggestion, **explain and defend it**:
1. **What**: the specific optimization (e.g., "eliminate redundant indicator variables for simple MAX constraints")
2. **Why it matters**: tie it back to the benchmark data — show which numbers would change and why (e.g., "Q3 has 120K vars for 60K rows, meaning 60K auxiliaries from the Big-M rewrite. Eliminating them halves the solver input.")
3. **Mechanism**: explain *how* the optimization works at the ILP level — why it produces an equivalent but smaller/tighter formulation
4. **Where**: the exact code path to modify

Format the output as:

```
### Analysis
- [key observations from the data]

### Suggested Optimization
**What**: [the optimization]
**Why**: [which benchmark numbers motivate this, and the expected impact]
**Mechanism**: [how it works at the ILP/formulation level]
**Where**: [specific files and code paths]
```
